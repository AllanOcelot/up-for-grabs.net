<h1><span class="header-inside">I maintain a project!</span></h1>

<p>
  We're looking for projects who can take the time out to
  help mentor developers as they get started with
  open source.
</p>

<p>
  What sort of tasks are a good fit?
  <ul class="numbered">
    <li><span>1</span>Tasks should take no longer than a few nights' worth of work</li>
    <li><span>2</span>Tasks should stand alone - avoid core functionality on which other tasks depend</li>
    <li><span>3</span>Tasks should be well described with pointers to help the implementer</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  We suggest the label <code>up-for-grabs</code> but using a different name is also acceptable.
</p>

  If this sounds like you, getting involved is simple:

<ul class="numbered">
 <li><span>1</span><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-labels-for-issues-and-pull-requests/" title="Creating and editing labels for issues and pull requests">Label</a> bugs and feature requests that would be a good place to start</li>
 <li><span>2</span>Grab the URL to this list of tasks so that others can get to it easily</li>
 <li><span>3</span><a href="https://github.com/login">Sign in to GitHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/up-for-grabs/up-for-grabs.net#add-a-project">check out the README.</a></li>
</ul>
